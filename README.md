## Before

# How do I use this?
This extension is based on the [chrome-extension-skeleton](https://github.com/salsita/chrome-extension-skeleton), so you should follow step 2 to get your own key for building the extension.

After that, install `npm` and run `npm install -g grunt-cli` and `npm install` inside the directory once again.

To build the extension, run `grunt default`.

To run the extension, drag and drop the extension into the `chrome://extension` window.
